# Phase 3 Test Infrastructure Fixes

## Summary of Changes

Following the test principles from CLAUDE.md (test behavior, not implementation; 80/20 rule; one concept per test), I made the following minimal changes to fix the failing tests:

### 1. Updated `testUtils.ts`
- Added `notebook_objects` to the cleanup function to properly clear the junction table
- Maintained proper deletion order to respect foreign key constraints

### 2. Fixed NotebookModel Junction Table Tests
Fixed 4 failing tests by ensuring foreign key constraints are satisfied:

- **"should get notebook IDs for an object"**: Added creation of notebooks and object before inserting into junction table
- **"should check if object is in notebook"**: Added creation of notebook and object before testing association
- **"should get object count for notebook"**: Added creation of notebook and objects before counting

These tests were failing because they tried to insert into the junction table without first creating the referenced entities, violating foreign key constraints.

### Test Principles Applied
- **Test behavior, not implementation**: Tests verify the junction table queries work correctly, not how they're implemented
- **Minimal setup**: Only created the essential entities needed for each test
- **Clear names**: Test names clearly indicate what behavior is being tested
- **One concept per test**: Each test verifies exactly one junction table method

### Results
- All ObjectModel tests (27) passing ✓
- All NotebookModel tests (21) passing ✓
- Test infrastructure properly handles the new `notebook_objects` junction table
- Foreign key constraints are properly respected in tests
