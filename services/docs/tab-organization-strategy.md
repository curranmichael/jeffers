# How to Organize Tabs Intelligently

The Problem: You have a tab open and want the system to figure out:
1. Which notebook it belongs in
2. Which group of tabs it should join
3. Whether it needs a new group or even a new notebook

The Solution: Use a combination of AI similarity matching and database lookups.

Finding the Right Notebook

When you have a tab about "React hooks":
1. AI compares the content to all your notebooks
2. Checks what's already in each notebook - if a notebook has lots of React content, that's a good sign
3. Scores each notebook based on both similarity and existing content
4. Suggests the best match - "This looks like it belongs in your 'Web Development' notebook"

Finding the Right Tab Group

Once we know the notebook, we look at tab groups inside it:
1. Look at existing tab groups in that notebook
2. Check if the new tab fits with tabs already in each group
3. Consider timing - if you were just looking at related tabs, they probably go together
4. Suggest the best group or propose creating a new one

The Magic: Three Types of Intelligence

1. Content Similarity (AI/Vectors)
- "This tab about React hooks is similar to other React documentation"
- Uses AI embeddings to understand meaning, not just keywords

2. Structural Relationships (Database)
- "This tab is in the Web Dev notebook, which contains these 5 tab groups"
- Fast lookups using traditional database tables

3. Behavioral Patterns (Time & History)
- "You were just looking at React docs 5 minutes ago"
- "You usually group API documentation together"

Why This Hybrid Approach Works

Instead of putting everything in JSON blobs (slow to search) or everything in rigid tables (inflexible), we:
- Use regular database tables for things we search often (which notebook contains what)
- Use AI vectors for understanding content meaning
- Use JSON only for rarely-accessed historical data

It's like having:
- A filing cabinet (database) for quick access to folders
- A smart assistant (AI) who understands what documents mean
- A diary (JSON history) for looking back at what happened when

Real Example

You open a tab about "React useState tutorial":
1. System thinks: "This is about React, let me check your notebooks"
2. Finds your "Web Development" notebook has lots of React content
3. Sees you have a tab group called "React Learning" with 5 other React tutorials
4. Notices you were looking at React docs 10 minutes ago
5. Suggests: "Add this to your 'React Learning' group in the Web Development notebook"

The beauty is it learns from your choices - if you move it somewhere else, it remembers and adjusts future suggestions.
