The Jeffers personal library consists of an intent stream (INS), working memory (WOM), long term memory (LOM), and ontological model (OM). So far, we’ve built things that go into LOM. 

Next, we’ll be building for WOM, which is a less rigorously processed (object only, no chunks) version of LOM, which also is more transient - we will want to assign a date that things were last accessed in the WOM, and degrade their search relevance on a weekly basis.

Tab groups are just classicbrowser windows with multiple tabs.
