# Cursor Rules: Ingestion (`ingestion/`)

1. One file per pipeline step (fetchUrl.ts, parseHtml.ts…).
2. Pure functions – no Electron/React/IPC.
3. Async, streaming‑friendly (AsyncGenerator preferred).
4. No persistence – delegate to models.
5. Config & API keys injected, never read .env directly.
6. Naming: verbNoun.ts.
