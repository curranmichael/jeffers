# Service Architecture Cleanup Summary

## Cleanup Tasks Completed

### 1. Removed Test Service
- Deleted `services/CanaryService.ts` - this was a test service used to validate the base infrastructure
- Removed all CanaryService references from `electron/bootstrap/serviceBootstrap.ts`
- Cleaned up ServiceRegistry type definition

### 2. Fixed ClassicBrowserService
- Renamed `destroy()` method to `cleanup()` to match BaseService interface
- Made the method async (`async cleanup(): Promise<void>`)
- Properly await the `destroyAllBrowserViews()` call with try-catch

### 3. Cleaned Build Cache  
- Removed `.next/cache/webpack/client-development/index.pack.gz.old` (564K)
- Removed `.next/cache/webpack/server-development/index.pack.gz.old` (612K)

### 4. Updated Service Registry Type
- Simplified the ServiceRegistry interface to use `[key: string]: IService | undefined`
- Removed the complex union type that explicitly listed all service types

### 5. Updated Documentation
- Updated `services/base/README.md` to reflect that all services have been migrated
- Removed outdated "Phase 2" next steps that have already been completed

### 6. Fixed Linting Issues
- Removed unused imports from `serviceBootstrap.ts`
- Commented out unused destructured config options

## Migration Status

All services now properly extend BaseService with:
- ✅ Dependency injection pattern
- ✅ Lifecycle management (initialize, cleanup, healthCheck)
- ✅ Consistent error handling
- ✅ Built-in logging with service context

## Notes on Workers

The UrlIngestionWorker and PdfIngestionWorker remain as workers (not services) in `electron/main.ts`. This appears to be intentional as they:
- Are instantiated with specific models from the service registry
- Are registered as processors with the IngestionQueueService
- Don't need the full service lifecycle management

The current architecture cleanly separates:
- **Services**: Long-lived components with lifecycle management
- **Workers**: Task processors that execute jobs from queues

No further changes are recommended for the worker pattern.
