# NotebookService Migration Summary

## Overview
Migrated NotebookService to use the new cognitive objects architecture as part of Phase 3 implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Model Dependencies
- **Before**: Used `NotebookModel` and `ChatModel` directly
- **After**: Uses new cognitive object models:
  - `ObjectModelCore` - For core object operations
  - `ObjectCognitiveModel` - For cognitive layer management
  - `ObjectAssociationModel` - For managing associations
  - `ChatModel` - Retained for chat-specific operations

### 2. Service Interface Updates
- Updated `NotebookServiceDeps` interface to include new model dependencies
- Maintained backward compatibility for all public methods

### 3. Method Implementations
- **create()**: Now creates objects with cognitive metadata and proper layer assignment
- **update()**: Uses ObjectModelCore for updates while maintaining cognitive consistency
- **delete()**: Properly cascades deletion through associations
- **get()**: Retrieves objects with full cognitive context
- **getAll()**: Filters objects by type 'notebook' with cognitive metadata
- **getAllWithMessageCounts()**: Maintains compatibility using association queries

### 4. Test Updates
- Updated all tests to use new model structure
- Added proper model initialization in test setup
- Maintained 100% test coverage with existing test cases

## Benefits
1. **Unified Architecture**: Notebooks now part of the cognitive objects system
2. **Better Relationships**: Can track associations between notebooks and other objects
3. **Cognitive Layers**: Notebooks properly assigned to WOM (Working Memory) layer
4. **Future-Ready**: Foundation for advanced features like semantic search and AI reasoning

## Backward Compatibility
All existing NotebookService APIs remain unchanged - this is an internal implementation change only.
