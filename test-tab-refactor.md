# Tab Management Refactoring Test

## What Was Changed

### 1. `createTab` Method
- Now fully atomic and authoritative
- Creates tab, sets it as active, loads URL, sends complete state update
- No longer calls `switchTab`

### 2. `closeTab` Method  
- Now fully atomic and authoritative
- Removes tab, determines next active tab, loads its URL, sends complete state update
- No longer calls `switchTab`

### 3. Key Improvements
- Each method is now independent and complete
- State updates are sent immediately after the action
- View (WebContentsView) is synchronized with state in the same method
- No indirect chains of responsibility

## Test Cases

1. **Create Tab**: Click + icon should immediately show new tab
2. **Close Tab**: Click X should immediately close tab and switch to adjacent
3. **Close Last Tab**: Closing last tab should replace it with new blank tab
4. **State Sync**: All actions should maintain consistent state between backend and frontend

## Expected Results
- No delay in tab creation display
- No "tab not found" errors when closing tabs
- Smooth, immediate UI updates for all tab operations
